# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

When clicking the generate password button

You receive a notification asking how many characters you want in your password

You select between 8 to 128 characters, if failure to do so you will receive an error until you select the minimum or maximum number allowed

Once you select the characters you want, the password is generated using lowercase letters a-z, uppercase A-Z, numbers 0-9 and special characters.
